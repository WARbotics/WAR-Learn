# lets start with creating a int varible 
number = 4 
# if I wanted to change it to a float it would just 
floatOfNumber = float(number)
# This would turn into 4.0 
# if I made float number a different a different number
floatOfNumber = 4.5 
# and change it back
int(floatOfNumber)
# This now becomes 4 and drops the .5
