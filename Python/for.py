# lets create a simple for loop
# That loops 4 times 
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(i)
    # Take notice of the I value becuase it bascially i+1 
    # becuase each time it loop it adds 1 to i and in a for - 
    # loop you can state were the number start which is the 
    # first argument in (1, 4)
