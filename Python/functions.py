# lets create a function
# that takes two arugments x,y and 
# and multiplys them
def myFunction(x,y):
    return x * y
    # Now you ask what is this return 
    # it is what the function gives out 
    # after being called

# so lets call it 
numbers = myFunction(5,6)
print(numbers)
# if run this it gives you 30
